What is this?
This is an effort by me to document my code online.
Ok but why?
By uploading my code online for documentation, I will be able toallow others to benefit from your work. Another reason is to save time and effort in further future projects.
How are you doing this?
This is done by utilising github pages along with Jekyll.
